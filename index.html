      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Juan and I am currently a student focusing on web
      development. My studies have equipped me with a solid foundation in
      various web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. I am
      always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies and trends in the web
      development industry.</p>

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt><h3>Aplications Web Developer</h3></dt>
        <dd>During the learning period of this course, I have acquired extensive
        knowledge of <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>,
        <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>PHP</strong>. Additionally, I
        have engaged in self-learning of <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, a popular
        HTML, CSS, and JS library used for building responsive and
        feature-packed frontend designs.  This comprehensive understanding of
        these technologies equips me with the basic skills necessary for web
        development and design. Also, during this time, I have learned to use
        technologies such as Git, GitHub, Azure, or AWS.</dd>
        <dt><h3>Microcomputer Systems and Networks</h3></dt>
        <dd>During those years, I learned the basic characteristics of networks,
        as well as the types of servers and protocols currently in use.
        Additionally, I learned to set up various servers such as
        <strong>DHCP</strong>, <strong>DNS</strong>, <strong>FTP</strong>,
        <strong>email server</strong>, etc. This time has helped me to better
        understand the technologies behind becoming a better web developer.</dd>

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt><h3>Web content editor (<em lang="ca">Universitat de Val√®ncia</em>)
        - FCTs</h3></dt>
        <dd>Mainly, I was responsible for modifying the content of the web
        pages.  We used a non-commercial CMS, which was created specifically for
        them, allowing us to easily modify each section of the page. Sometimes,
        when it couldn't be done with the CMS, we would also modify some things
        with raw HTML. This was a great first work experience for me.</dd>

          <h3>Tic Tac Toe</h3>
          <p>Here is the Tic-Tac-Toe game made in <strong>Java</strong> where we
          used threads, libraries, database access, and sockets for online LAN
          play. It includes a login for accessing your user account or
          registering, and offers both online and single-player modes. It also
          stores your wins, losses, and draws.</p>
